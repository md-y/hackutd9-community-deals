A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project was developed by Samuel Preston, Safa Mohammed, Kara Ng, and Fatima Khalid

Description:
Community Deals is an app for the everyday consumer. People who love to shop, 
people who want to shop, people who need to shop. This app aids users in their shopping 
experience by doing two things:
1. Provides users with a feed of discount in stores within a chosen location.
2. It allows you to communicate with friends/trusted peers to take advantage on deals that may be available to a specific person.

To further expand on point 2 using an example --> a user posts that they are about to make an order at a specific site.
Other trusted users/friends can also buy something in the same order and pay the user back through the app. 
This allows them to save on shipping costs and other extraneous fees as well as take advantage of a certain personalized discount.

Implements the use of the Capital One Nessie API, the Google Maps API, and Firebase API, and PlotRewards API.
